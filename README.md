Twitter Collection app for Android.

![](docs/_static/login.png?raw=true)


Credentials
-----------
The [Fabric] integrations require a `app/fabric.properties` file containing secrets which has not
been included in this repository. Use the [Fabric plugin] to onboard or copy/paste your own keys
into this file.

[Fabric]: https://fabric.io
[Fabric plugin]: https://get.fabric.io/android

It should have the following format:

    apiSecret=<64 character hex string>
    twitterPluginId=<14 character hex string>

The Login with Twitter and Twitter API functionality requires a Twitter Application consumer key
and secret to be provided in `app/src/main/assets/app.properties`. This is a Java properties file
and should have the following format.

    twitter_key=<24 character base 64 string>
    twitter_secret=<50 character base 64 string>
